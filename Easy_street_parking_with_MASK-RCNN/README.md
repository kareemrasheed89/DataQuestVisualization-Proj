# Easy_street_parking_with_MASK-RCNN

Pre-trained Mask-RCNN from Matterport can be easily used to detect cars in a parking. In order to utilize it I recorded a video of the parking near my apartment. Even with my hands shaking due to cold, the overall prototype successfully detect an available parking space vacancy.

Observe the change of color in the other parking spots. It is primarily due to moving camera while recording, the car parked in the area gets out from the marked spot. Using Twilio API, we can easy generate a number and use it to send a custom message to our own cell phone whenever there's a vacancy available to park. There's a great medium post here which describes the process flow. The underlying assumption is that, the first frame will determine the parking spots and no car in the first frame should be a moving one.

This is very inconvenient. We can't expect to take our cell phone out and get bluffed by a moving car just because it was in the first frame. So, we need to think of something better. What about identifying the static cars by observing them for 5 seconds and assuming that they are parked in the authorized parking area only. This way, no moving cars would hamper our system.

```python
    while video_capture.isOpened():
        success, frame = video_capture.read()

        if not success:
            print("couldn't read video")
            break

        elif counter<40:
          #create another video reader object to compare the two frames   and verify the possibility of motion
          success, frame2 = video_capture.read()
          d = cv2.absdiff(frame, frame2)  
          grey = cv2.cvtColor(d, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
          blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(grey, (1, 1), 0)
          ret, th = cv2.threshold( blur, 20, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

          #perform these morphological transformations to erode the car which is moving so that it is not detected by MASKRCNN. Take the erosion levels to be high. 
          dilated = cv2.dilate(th, np.ones((30, 30), np.uint8), iterations=1 )
          eroded = cv2.erode(dilated, np.ones((30, 30), np.uint8), iterations=1 )

          #fill the contours for even a better morphing of the vehicle
          img, c, h = cv2.findContours(eroded, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
          frame2 = cv2.drawContours(frame2, c, -1, (0,0,0), cv2.FILLED)

```

The approach is pretty simple. I just took two frames and compared them for a possible motion using Adaptive Background Learning. Next I eroded the area occupied by the moving vehicle so that MASK-RCNN would not capture it.

Let's check how well our system performs in night, just for the fun :)

What if we use IPhone 7 plus ? let's see:

    <em>Far better! It's funny how the leftmost car gets identified by MASK-RCNN with full confidence as soon as the headlights of the 'Camry' focus on it</em>

Easy, right! Now all I have for you guys is to check my other Yolo repository to see how we can speed up the process using batch-processing. Essentially, I am asking you to read multiple frames, keep them in buffer and then send them for processing to GPU at once to maximize GPU utilization. This way you might be able to take advantage of colab's 12 GB of free K80.
Have fun and do let me know if you come up with any further cool ideas! You can find the code on my Git. The code is runnable on Google Colab. Check out my [tutorial video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNT6S_VBNc) where I setup the colab and code the whole thing while explaining the
logic behind it.

If we use something fast like ThinYOLO (computationally efficient and good accuracy) and adopt a pub-sub type architecture to subscribe to such an application, it should work well in a real-time parking without much retraining and maintenance cost. Moreover, there's no permission issue as in case of installing sensors.
